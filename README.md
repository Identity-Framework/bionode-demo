# BionodeDemo

## [Read the WIKI!](https://github.com/Identity-Framework/bionode-demo/wiki)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.1.2.

## Development server

If you don't alreay have it installed you will need to install ng by running `npm install -g @angular/cli`

Build the client app by running `ng build` in the project root.

From here you have two options:

1. Start up the node server by running `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`.
    * This will spin up the nodejs server and the Angular application.
2. Only start the Angular app with no server side using `ng serve -o`. 
    * This has the benefit of compiling the client-side app on file change and reflecting that in the browser, but you will 
      not have access to the server side logic this way.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
